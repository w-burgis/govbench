      "explanation": "To determine whether the submitted answer contains the content of the expert answer, we'll analyze both answers against the definition provided by the expert.\n\n1. **Understanding of a Foreign National**:\n   - **Expert Answer**: Defines a foreign national specifically as \"any person other than a US citizen, US permanent or temporary legal resident alien, or person in US custody.\"\n   - **Submission**: States that a \"foreign national\" refers to \"any individual who is not a citizen or national of a given country,\" specifically mentioning the context of the United States and providing an explanation focused on not holding U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status.\n\n2. **Key Components**:\n   - The expert defines who a foreign national is within the jurisdiction of U.S. law, delineating between U.S. citizens, legal residents, and individuals in custody. \n   - The submission acknowledges that a foreign national is someone who does not hold U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status, which matches a core part of the expert's definition.\n   - The submission also provides additional context about the subject being relevant to immigration and customs laws, which, while informative, does not directly negate or alter the definition provided by the expert.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Both answers align on the core requirement for someone to be classified as a foreign national in the U.S. context—namely, not being a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.\n   - The submission expands the definition slightly by discussing how foreign nationals are affected by various laws but does not introduce any conflicting or inaccurate information regarding the definition itself.\n\n4. **Final Evaluation**:\n   - The main definition component from the expert is present in the submission. Therefore, it fulfills the requirement to reflect the content of the expert answer accurately.\n\nSince the submission effectively captures the essence of the expert's definition without omitting critical elements, we can conclude that it is correct.\n\nGRADE: C",
