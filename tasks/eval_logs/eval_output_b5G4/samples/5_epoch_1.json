      "explanation": "To determine whether the submitted answer contains the content of the expert answer, I will break down the key components of both answers and compare them directly.\n\n1. **Key Premise of the Expert Answer**: The expert states that \"Service component commanders are responsible for providing accurate personnel visibility and strength reporting data to the CCDR for their respective Service.\" This explicitly identifies the responsibility of service component commanders in relation to the CCDR.\n\n2. **Key Premise of the Submitted Answer**: The submission asserts that \"the responsibility for providing personnel visibility and strength reporting data for each Service to the Combatant Commander (CCDR) primarily lies with the Service components through their respective personnel management systems.\" It also describes that each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces manages their personnel and reports data as part of joint operations.\n\n3. **Responsibility Identified**: \n    - The expert answer identifies \"Service component commanders\" specifically as being responsible for the reporting to the CCDR.\n    - The submitted answer indicates that the \"Service components\" bear this responsibility but does not specify the role of \"Commanders\" directly, instead referring to it more generally.\n\n4. **Detail on Systems Used**: \n    - The submitted answer includes further detail by mentioning \"personnel management systems\" and \"personnel accounting systems\" used by the Services to manage and report data. This additional information is not in the expert answer but adds context around how the responsibility is implemented.\n\n5. **Supportive Roles**: The submission mentions the support of \"the Joint Staff and the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC)\" in data consolidation and visibility, which is also missing in the expert answer.\n\n6. **Comparison**: While the expert answer concisely states the responsibility attributed to Service component commanders, the submitted answer elaborates on this by discussing the mechanisms and systems involved, as well as the supporting entities. However, the core obligation as stated by the expert is maintained.\n\nIn conclusion, the submitted answer encompasses the essential content found in the expert answer regarding who provides personnel visibility and strength data to the CCDR while adding relevant details. The responsibility remains clear, though somewhat elaborated in the submission.\n\nGiven that the submission adheres correctly to the core substance of the expert answer, I evaluate it as correct.\n\nThus, the final grading assessment is:\nGRADE: C",
