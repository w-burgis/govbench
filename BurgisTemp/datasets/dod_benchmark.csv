Navy,"Compare how the Department of Defense framed its justification for Freedom of Navigation operations in FY1991 vs FY2023. What role does UNCLOS play in each document, and how does the U.S. reconcile its legal stance without having ratified the treaty?","In FY1991, the DoD framed FON operations as essential to resisting excessive maritime claims that might become customary international law if unchallenged. UNCLOS was referenced only indirectly, emphasizing customary law principles. By FY2023, the DoD explicitly aligns its FON operations with UNCLOS frameworks, referencing specific articles, despite the U.S. not having ratified the treaty. The strategy emphasizes international norms and legal consistency.",open-ended,,https://www.secnav.navy.mil/fon/Documents/FY1991_DoD_Annual_FON_Report.pdf
Navy,How do the FY1991 and FY2023 DoD FON reports reflect changes in U.S. naval strategic priorities? Identify the geographic regions of focus in each and explain what that says about U.S. concerns during each era.,"The FY1991 report focuses on post–Cold War force reductions and regional contingencies (e.g., Persian Gulf), reflecting a unipolar world. FY2023, by contrast, emphasizes contested regions like the South China Sea and the Strait of Hormuz, indicating a shift to multipolar threats and a greater emphasis on maintaining global maritime order.",open-ended,,https://www.secnav.navy.mil/fon/Documents/FY1991_DoD_Annual_FON_Report.pdf
Navy,What are the most significant differences in the types of maritime claims challenged in FY1991 versus FY2023? How does this reflect the evolution of maritime security threats?,"FY1991 challenges focused on excessive territorial seas and prior notification requirements. FY2023 challenges increasingly target EEZ restrictions, archipelagic baselines, and strait passage violations. This reflects the evolution from basic sovereignty claims to more nuanced control over strategic sea lanes and airspace.",open-ended,,https://www.secnav.navy.mil/fon/Documents/FY1991_DoD_Annual_FON_Report.pdf
Navy,"Evaluate the differences in tone, legal sophistication, and audience targeting between the FY1991 and FY2023 Freedom of Navigation reports. How has the Department of Defense changed how it communicates FON policy and why might that matter?","The FY1991 report uses a policy-centric, defense-posture narrative with minimal legal citations. FY2023 adopts a legally rigorous tone, incorporating UNCLOS citations, treaty articles, and diplomatic statements—indicating a professionalization of FON communications and a shift toward norm-setting behavior.",open-ended,,https://www.secnav.navy.mil/fon/Documents/FY1991_DoD_Annual_FON_Report.pdf
airforce,How does the FY 2023 Posture Statement frame “freedom of air operations” in contested environments—especially near China and Russia? Compare this framing with maritime FON principles.,"It emphasizes the need for operational agility in contested environments, citing threats to access and overflight by peer adversaries like China and Russia. It asserts the right to conduct global strike and ISR operations under international law, paralleling the Navy’s FON operations in asserting global domain access rights.",freeform,,https://www.af.mil/Portals/1/documents/2023SAF/AF_2023_Posture_Statement.pdf
airforce,Identify how forward presence and global strike capabilities are justified legally and strategically. How does this resemble or diverge from maritime claim challenges in FON?,"Forward basing is presented as a deterrence mechanism under the doctrine of integrated deterrence. Legal justification rests on bilateral agreements and sovereign permissions. Unlike maritime FON, these rights are granted case-by-case, rather than assumed through customary law or treaty frameworks like UNCLOS.",freeform,,https://www.af.mil/Portals/1/documents/2023SAF/AF_2023_Posture_Statement.pdf
cyber,Explain how the 2023 DoD Cyber Strategy frames “freedom of cyber maneuver” and “defend-forward.” How is this analogous to or distinct from maritime FON principles?,"The strategy frames cyber freedom as essential to national security, with “defend-forward” enabling proactive engagement of adversaries before they reach U.S. infrastructure. This mirrors the FON logic of asserting domain dominance, but within an amorphous legal environment where norms are still emerging.",freeform,,https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/12/2003299938/-1/-1/1/2023-DOD-CYBER-STRATEGY-UNCLASSIFIED-SUMMARY.PDF
cyber,"Assess how the Cyber Strategy articulates legal positioning and international norms (e.g., toward state actors), and compare this to UNCLOS-based legal framing in maritime FON.","The strategy stresses compliance with international law, particularly sovereignty and non-intervention principles. However, it acknowledges the lack of codified treaties like UNCLOS in cyber. It promotes norm-building through multilateral forums, much like FON operations challenge maritime norms to prevent excessive state control.",freeform,,https://media.defense.gov/2023/Sep/12/2003299938/-1/-1/1/2023-DOD-CYBER-STRATEGY-UNCLASSIFIED-SUMMARY.PDF
army,"In the FY 2025 Army Posture Statement, what legal and strategic language supports land-domain ‘freedom of movement’—particularly regarding SOFAs and corridor access?","The FY 2025 Army Posture Statement emphasizes strategic access enabled through bilateral agreements, Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs), and prepositioned assets. It frames freedom of movement in terms of logistical reach, strategic depth, and coalition interoperability. The legal basis lies in negotiated agreements with host nations and international legal principles of military access during peacetime and contingency operations.",freeform,,https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/aps/aps_2025.pdf
army,Compare how the Army posture statement positions ground access rights in Indo-Pacific or European theaters to how the Navy asserts maritime FON.,"The Army posture statement emphasizes negotiated access through SOFAs, infrastructure investment, and multinational training zones—particularly in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific. While the Navy challenges excessive maritime claims directly through operations, the Army relies more heavily on allied coordination and forward basing to ensure domain access.",freeform,,https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/aps/aps_2025.pdf
spaceforce,How does the USSF Commercial Space Strategy define ‘freedom of access to space’ and what norms or legal references does it employ? Compare with the framework used in maritime FON citing UNCLOS.,"The USSF Commercial Space Strategy defines freedom of access as the ability to launch, maneuver, and operate in space without harmful interference. It references the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 rather than UNCLOS, focusing on norms like responsible behavior, transparency, and debris mitigation. Like FON operations, it emphasizes preserving domain access by challenging restrictive behaviors, albeit in a norm-development context.",freeform,,https://www.spaceforce.mil/Portals/1/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy_2024.pdf
spaceforce,Examine how DoD’s 2024 Commercial Space Integration Strategy establishes access norms across conflict phases—how does this operational concept reflect or deviate from maritime FON operational challenges?,"The strategy outlines a phased approach to access during competition, crisis, and conflict—emphasizing resiliency, dual-use coordination, and commercial integration. Unlike FON, which relies on physical assertions, space access is enforced through partnerships, deterrence, and infrastructure hardening. Both prioritize domain access but differ in methods due to the nature of the operational environment.",freeform,,https://media.defense.gov/2024/May/14/2003451845/-1/-1/0/DOD-COMMERCIAL-SPACE-INTEGRATION-STRATEGY.PDF
